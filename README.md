Hi!

From the Author: Since I’ve been working on different OS environments, with different software and server versions, my goal always have been compatibility, scalability and fast implementation. Too sophisticated, difficult to read code, which sometimes requires additional and difficult to build modules - could produce negative impact on productivity. Sometimes unnecessary “top-notch” implementations could produce undesirable delays and affect the whole project. Especially, it’s important when working with sensitive financial or scientific data.

Thank you.
Sergiy Zalyubovskiy.
